          <p>By flipping through tabs and clicking through links, <br>
            you've stumbled across this little garden. <br>
            As you can see, it is quite empty right now. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to start the garden's life cycle whenever <br>
            by clicking "Grow". But like all things in nature, <br>
            once this garden starts growing, <br>
            it can't be stopped by a simple click of a button. 
          </p>

        <div class='info2'>
          <p>
            To plant some seeds, click on üå± and then <br>
            click on any soil cell on the grid. The deeper you <br>
            plant the seed, the longer it will take the plant to <br>
            dig its way above the soil. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you happen to plant it too deep, it might not reach the top! <br>
            Even if you don't see anything happening right now, <br>
            you'd have to trust that the seeds are actually growing. <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='info3'>
          <p>
            You might want to also take care of the plants. <br>
            To water the garden, you will need to build a hose, <br>
            or several hoses. <br>
           </p>
           <p> 
            Click on üö∞ and build hoses like so. <br>
            The end of the hose must be connected to the edge of <br>
            the garden, and there needs to be a proper nozzle. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take apart the hoses any time and build as many <br>
            hoses as you want, as long as they can fit on screen. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='info4'>
          <p>
            Click on üíß to turn on the water <br>
            (and click again to turn it off... duh). <br>
            Water will only turn on if the hose is built well -- <br>
            that means no broken hoses... <br>
            although a little crinkle here or there might be okay...

          Ooooh? A mysterious patch of soil? 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='info6'>
          <p>
            Speaking of soil, you can check the soil's nutrient <br>
            content by clicking on üåê <br>
            Light brown squares means that the soil is dehydrated, <br>
            and dark brown means that the soil is doing very well, <br>
            but deep brown means that the soil REALLY needs water. <br>

          As you can see, it's not difficult to grow a little garden, <br>
          as long as you come back to maintain it every once in a while <br>
          (... except maintaining it right now is a little difficult since <br>
          the garden's current state can't be saved on the browser just yet). <br> 
          You can always click on "Garden Info" if you ever need a reminder.
